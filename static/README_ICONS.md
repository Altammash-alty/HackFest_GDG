# Icon Files

The PWA manifest references icon files (`icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`). 

Currently, placeholder files are included. For production, you should:

1. Create proper icon images:
   - `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
   - `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

2. You can use any image editor or online tools like:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/

3. The app will work without proper icons, but PWA installation may not show a custom icon.

For now, the app functions normally - icons are optional for basic functionality.
